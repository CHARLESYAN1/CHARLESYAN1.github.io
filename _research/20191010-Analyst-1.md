### Abstract
This paper examines the associations among financial analysts’ perceived facial traits, their forecast accuracy, and career development. By applying machine learning techniques to the LinkedIn profile pictures of 795 U.S. sell-side analysts, we extract three key factors of perceived facial traits for individual analysts – approachability, attractiveness, and dominance. We show that approachability and dominance are positively associated with forecast accuracy, and the effect is mostly driven by male analysts and senior analysts. Attractiveness is positively associated with forecast accuracy, but only among junior analyst, and in the pre-Reg FD period. Dominant and approachable analysts tend to produce longer reports, and dominant analysts participate in conference calls more frequently. Approachable and attractive analysts are more likely to be voted all-star analysts by institutional investors. Our findings suggest that facial traits play an important role in the performance and the career path of sell-side analysts.
