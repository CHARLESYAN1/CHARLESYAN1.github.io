### Outstanding undergraduate thesis of class 2014, SWUFE
### Abstract
This paper examines the connection between analyst characteristics and their
performance. Employing a Naïve Bayes algorithm and key facial landmarks
detection approach on analyst profiles and text in analyst reports, we extract textual
opinion from analyst reports and analyst personality traits from their standard
profile images. We find that both intrinsic and extrinsic analyst characteristics are
correlated with the qualitative textual descriptions in analyst reports, but not with
quantitative EPS forecasts; and certain welcomed attributes reduce analysts’
predicting errors. We also find that analysts with higher attractiveness are more
likely to have favorable career outcomes.
