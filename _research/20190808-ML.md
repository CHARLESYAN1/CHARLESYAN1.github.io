*Machine Learning Engined Asset Pricing: Empirical Evidence from China Financial Market* [[Paper]]()

### Abstract
This paper examines the effectiveness of various machine learning models in China financial market. By constructing 91 firm-level factor loadings in prior literature, extracting 9 sentiment factors through collecting TB level textual data, and merging with 8 macroeconomic indexes from 2000 to 2018, asset pricing can be successfully engined by as many as 989 pricing factors. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis among nine machine learning models, Partial Least Square (PLS), Ridge Regression (Ridge) and Linear Support Vector Regression (LSVR) are identified as the top three most successful models resulting lowest prediction errors and highest out-of-sample prediction accuracy. Characteristics of importance analysis further indicates that book-to-market ratio (BM), earnings-to-price ratio (EP) and industry momentum (INDMOM) are the top 3 most dominant predictive loadings as they explain most portion of return variances. Further, all machine learning models unambiguously agree that sentiment factors derived from textual contents are effective. Sentiment predicting power exists in both analyst report and social media posts, but is strongest in traditional news media. Last, portfolio risk and return analysis proves machine learning models can generate real economic gains by constructing long-short equal-weighted decile portfolio to get an average of 3.40%, 2.64% and 1.92% monthly returns and 0.85, 0.66 and 0.49 annualized Sharpe ratios for PLS, Ridge, and LSVR, respectively.
