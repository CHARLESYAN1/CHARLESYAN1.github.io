### Abstract
This paper examines the eï¬€ectiveness of various machine learning models in explaining and predicting returns in the Chinese stock market. We construct 91 firm-level factor loadings, extract 9 sentiment factors from textual data, and merge with 8 macroeconomic indexes from 2000 to 2018. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis among nine machine learning models, Partial Least Square (PLS), Ridge Regression (Ridge) and Linear Support Vector Regression (LSVR) are identified as the top three most successful models resulting lowest prediction errors and highest out-of-sample prediction accuracy. Characteristics of importance analysis further indicate that book-to-market ratio (BM), earnings-to-price ratio (EP), and industry momentum (INDMOM) are the top 3 most dominant predictive loadings as they explain most portion of return variances. Further, all machine learning models unambiguously agree that sentiment factors derived from textual contents are important asset-pricing factors in China. The predicting power of sentiment exists in both the text of analyst reports and social media posts but is strongest in traditional news media. Last, portfolio risk and return analysis proves machine learning models can generate real economic gains by constructing long-short equal-weighted decile portfolio to get an average of 3.40%, 2.64% and 1.92% monthly returns and 0.85, 0.66 and 0.49 annualized Sharpe ratios for PLS, Ridge, and LSVR, respectively.
