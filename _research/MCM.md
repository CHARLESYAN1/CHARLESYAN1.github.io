excerpt: "In this paper, we focus on evaluating potential commercial opportunities in removing space debris that is currently revolving around the Earth in low Earth orbit since the growing number of aerospace debris has been a major concern around the world community. Three models are presented to analyze this problem from distinguishing perspectives, namely, the potential economical profits, the probability of collision and the role of the policy maker"
