### Abstract
This paper examines the associations among financial analysts’ perceived facial traits, their forecast accuracy, and career development. By applying machine learning techniques to the LinkedIn profile pictures of 795 U.S. sell-side analysts, we extract three key factors of perceived facial traits for individual analysts – approachability, attractiveness, and dominance. We show that approachability and dominance are positively associated with forecast accuracy, and the effect is mostly driven by male analysts and senior analysts. Attractiveness is positively associated with forecast accuracy, but only among junior analyst, and in the pre-Reg FD period. Dominant and approachable analysts tend to produce longer reports, and dominant analysts participate in conference calls more frequently. Approachable and attractive analysts are more likely to be voted all-star analysts by institutional investors. Our findings suggest that facial traits play an important role in the performance and the career path of sell-side analysts.

### Abstract
This paper examines the effectiveness of various machine learning models in China financial market. By constructing 91 firm-level factor loadings in prior literature, extracting 9 sentiment factors through collecting TB level textual data, and merging with 8 macroeconomic indexes from 2000 to 2018, asset pricing can be successfully engined by as many as 989 pricing factors. Through a comprehensive comparative analysis among nine machine learning models, Partial Least Square (PLS), Ridge Regression (Ridge) and Linear Support Vector Regression (LSVR) are identified as the top three most successful models resulting lowest prediction errors and highest out-of-sample prediction accuracy. Characteristics of importance analysis further indicates that book-to-market ratio (BM), earnings-to-price ratio (EP) and industry momentum (INDMOM) are the top 3 most dominant predictive loadings as they explain most portion of return variances. Further, all machine learning models unambiguously agree that sentiment factors derived from textual contents are effective. Sentiment predicting power exists in both analyst report and social media posts, but is strongest in traditional news media. Last, portfolio risk and return analysis proves machine learning models can generate real economic gains by constructing long-short equal-weighted decile portfolio to get an average of 3.40%, 2.64% and 1.92% monthly returns and 0.85, 0.66 and 0.49 annualized Sharpe ratios for PLS, Ridge, and LSVR, respectively.

### Abstract
In this paper, we focus on evaluating potential commercial opportunities in removing space debris that is currently revolving around the Earth in low Earth orbit since the growing number of aerospace debris has been a major concern around the world community. Three models are presented to analyze this problem from distinguishing perspectives, namely, the potential economical profits, the probability of collision and the role of the policy maker.
